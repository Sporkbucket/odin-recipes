    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Sometimes, nothing is better than a fresh, green salad! My grandfather preferred spinach leaves with just a drizzle of oil, and he lived to be a grandfather. If you like fresh produce, I highly recommend this as the best salad. I love it, or any greens that grow in your area. Eat it plain or dress it up with some oil and vinegar and it's a great salad to enjoy on its own or as a side.  </p>
    <p>The only thing I don' t like is eating it when it is still hot and steaming hot. That is the worst time to eat it and I would hate to have the same reaction as my grandfather, so be careful when you eat hot food.  Keto is very good for people with diabetes. We call it the 'keto diet' because this is how it sounds.</p>

    <h5>FAQ</h5>
    <p> <b>Q</b> Can I really put anything in a salad?</p>
    <p> <b>A</b> Yes! That's the beauty of it! Just add a plant, and anything can be a salad!</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Q</b> Why doesn't that sound right?</p>
    <p><b>A</b> This question is frequently asked, but also unanswerable. Can any of us be held accounable for another's lack of comprehension, much less explain it? If I tried, would not that only widen the gap between us? Let us say, for instance, that I simplified my language, inevitably sacrificing some precision. What might the outcomes be? You might understand me now, but only because I said something else, something simpler. On the other hand, you may have wanted clarification instead of simplification, in which case my simplistic rephrasing would likely annoy you. You nobly invited me to think with you, and I implied you are not capable of thought. Now we have two miscommunications instead of one. How they multiply! Much better, then, to accept our limitations - explain nothing, elaborate never, express freely and without a thought, for thought is unrelated to expression. To ask for an explanation is to beg a walking man's shadow for alms. Do not debase yourself. Stand up and walk, on your own legs, into the glorious, senseless sun.</p>
