    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Do you hate Mondays? I sure don't! On the rare occasion that I do feel like a Grumpy Gertie, nothing cheers me up like a big dollop of lasagna. Geeze, I guess I could just make it a low-carb lasagne! | The Atkins Diet is an extreme low carbohydrate, low fat, and high-fat diet for weight loss and long-term health. </p>
    <p> The Atkins diet works by dramatically reducing carbohydrates and increasing fats and protein. Once you've completed the diet, you're left with about 2 cups of liquid. No carb counting, no counting carbs, just plain good old fashioned carbs.  As for your eating habits, the keto diet makes no sense to me. But I'm not an expert, so if I can make up my own rules, then so can you!</p>
